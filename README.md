## Meet the team
Syntactic sugar, the term is one that is commonly known within the programming community.It is a term that loosely refers to the writing of easy to understand, clear and concise code.  All members of the team are passionate about programming and technology in general, thus we takegreat pride in the work we produce.  Even the most complex of problems can be broken downinto more simple and easier to solve problems.
