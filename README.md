# Jargon
## Syntactic Sugar (Team 9)
### Project Description
Jargon is an AI-driven social listening and sentiment analysis platform. Jargon provides users the ability to analyse the sentiments of tweets centered around a specific topic/topics.

This analysis is performed automatically by the system and presented to the user in a format that best allows them to interpret and interact with the data to make better informed business/personal decisions.

The intended use is focused on, but not limited to, market research. The user interface is, however, intuitive and easy to understand, allowing for anyone interested to make use of the system.
